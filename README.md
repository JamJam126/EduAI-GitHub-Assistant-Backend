This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing user-submitted code in an isolated container environment using Docker and BullMQ queues. It allows multiple concurrent code executions while ensuring isolation and resource management.

The POC includes:

Backend API for submitting and tracking code execution jobs.
Worker that xecutes code inside Docker containers.
BullMQ queue for handling multiple submissions concurrently.
Admin dashboard for monitoring jobs.
Frontend job submission script for testing.

Features:

Execute Python code safely inside containers.
Queue multiple code execution requests using BullMQ.
Concurrency control for simultaneous job execution.
Real-time monitoring with Bull Board dashboard.
Minimal example frontend script to submit 100 jobs automatically.

Installation & Setup


1. Install dependencies
npm install

2. Start Redis

BullMQ requires Redis. 
Make sure Redis is running on localhost:6379.

3. Build Docker images
docker build -t code-runner-python ./docker
# Optional: build C image if supported
# docker build -t code-runner-c ./docker-c

4. Start backend API
node backend/server.js

5. Start dashboard (optional)
node backend/dashboard.js


Access dashboard at: http://localhost:8081/admin/queues

6. Submit test jobs
node frontend/submitJobs.js

Usage : 

Submit a job: POST /run with JSON body:

{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "print('Hello world')"
}


Check job status: GET /status/:jobId : 

{
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "state": "completed",
  "result": {
    "stdout": "Hello world",
    "status": "success"
  }
}


Dashboard monitoring: Visit /admin/queues to see queued, active, and completed jobs.
